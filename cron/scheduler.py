    ``reply_in_thread: false`` routes an inbound plain reply to.

    Unlike the thread path, the shipped delivery-mirror alone is NOT sufficient
    here: ``mirror_to_session`` only APPENDS to a session that already EXISTS
    (``_find_session_id`` → no-op when none matches), and a flat channel
    ``(…, None)`` row is only created when a human posts a top-level message the
    bot processes — a ``chat_postMessage`` cron delivery never goes through the
    inbound handler, so the row is usually absent and the mirror silently drops
    the brief (verified live: the brief never landed, the reply had no context).
    So we CREATE the flat session row first, exactly like
    ``_seed_cron_thread_session`` does for threads, then mirror into it.

    The session KEY must match what the user's later inbound reply resolves to
    (``build_session_key``):
    - **Channel** (``chat_type="group"``): key is
      ``…:group:<chat_id>:<user_id>`` — user-isolated — so the seed MUST carry
      the **origin's real ``user_id``** (the member who scheduled the job), NOT
      a synthetic ``system:cron`` id, or the reply keys to a different session.
    - **1:1 DM** (``chat_type="dm"``): the key is ``…:dm:<chat_id>`` and does
      NOT embed ``user_id``, so any ``user_id`` resolves to the same session.
    ``chat_type`` mirrors the inbound handler's own choice
    (``"dm" if is_dm else "group"``, ``adapter.py``), so the seeded key is
    byte-identical to the reply's key.

    Returns True if a seed row was created and the brief mirrored, else False
    (caller falls back to the plain mirror). Best-effort — a delivery that
    already succeeded is never failed by a seeding problem.

    Plugs the #3968 gap: ``_scan_cron_prompt`` runs on the user-supplied
    prompt at create/update, but skill content is loaded from disk at
    runtime and was never scanned. Since cron runs non-interactively
    (auto-approves tool calls), a malicious skill carrying an injection
    payload bypassed every gate.

    Two pattern tiers, selected by what the assembled prompt CONTAINS,
    not just whether skills are attached:

    - When the assembled prompt is essentially the user prompt + the cron
      hint (no skills, no injected data), the STRICT ``_scan_cron_prompt``
      patterns apply: a bare ``rm -rf /`` in a small directive prompt is a
      smoking gun, not prose.
    - When the assembled prompt includes runtime-loaded content — skill
      markdown (``has_skills=True``) or DATA injected from a job script's
      stdout / an upstream job's output (``has_injected_data=True``) — the
      LOOSER ``_scan_cron_skill_assembled`` pattern set is used: only
      unambiguous prompt-injection directives block; command-shape
      patterns are dropped and invisible unicode is sanitized (stripped +
      logged) rather than blocked, to avoid false-positives that
      permanently kill a job. Skill bodies are vetted at install time by
      ``skills_guard.py``; script output is produced by operator-authored
      code, the same trust class — and data feeds (e.g. a triage bot
      ingesting bug reports) legitimately quote dangerous commands.

    When the looser tier is selected because of injected data only,
    ``user_prompt`` (the raw, pre-assembly prompt) is additionally scanned
    with the STRICT set so the user-authored surface keeps the full
    create/update-time guarantee at runtime (defense-in-depth for legacy
