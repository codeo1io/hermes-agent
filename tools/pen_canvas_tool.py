"""Drive a pen.dev design canvas from the Hermes desktop GUI.

Hermes desktop hosts the user's installed pen.dev editor in "Canvas" tabs
(apps/desktop/electron/pen-canvas.ts). This tool is the agent's door into that
canvas: it round-trips through the gateway's blocking-prompt bridge — the same
one ``read_preview`` uses — so it works wherever the CLIENT is, remote
backends included. tui_gateway emits ``pen.tool.request``, the renderer runs
the pen operation against the live canvas (or the user's running pen.dev
desktop app when no Canvas tab is open — the HUD-mode path) and answers with
``pen.tool.respond``.

This module is just schema + a thin dispatcher over the platform-injected
callback; the pen operation names and payloads pass through verbatim so the
editor's own tool surface stays the source of truth.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset, which the GUI gateway enables only for
desktop-sourced sessions.
