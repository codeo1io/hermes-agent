"""Regression tests for _release_running_agent_state and SessionDB shutdown.

Before this change, running-agent state lived in three dicts that drifted
out of sync:

  self._running_agents       — AIAgent instance per session key
  self._running_agents_ts    — start timestamp per session key
  self._busy_ack_ts          — last busy-ack timestamp per session key

Six cleanup sites did ``del self._running_agents[key]`` without touching
the other two; one site only popped ``_running_agents`` and
``_running_agents_ts``; and only the stale-eviction site cleaned all
three.  Each missed entry was a small persistent leak.

Also: SessionDB connections were never closed on gateway shutdown,
leaving WAL locks in place until Python actually exited.
